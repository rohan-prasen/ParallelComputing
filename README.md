# Introduction
  Hi, I am Rohan Prasen Kedari. This repository is developed to implement parallel computing.
## Why JAVA?
  JAVA is a robust and versatile language. I preferred JAVA because of its rich APIs and it's flexibity and ease of use. I had to implement many types of components in the code. For example, I had to use networking at one or the other point in my code to connect the two or more devices to each other. JAVA makes it easier for me to implement network connection between the client and the server machine.
## Re-usability
  Most of the code that I have developed is re-usable, even the IP Address bracket of the Server connection is a dynamically typed String, making the code versatile and reusable. 
## Parallel Computing 
  Here, in this project I have used the `concurrent` package and `executors` service introduced to JAVA in it's JAVA 8 version. This service enables us to use every core in the processor illustrating the Parallel computing concept.
## Ease of USE
  The code is easy to use to the end-user, as there will be prompts everywhere in the code.
# Thanking note 
  Thanks for spending your time reviewing my code. Feel free to contribute your ideas to the code. Fork this repository to your personal repository and start debugging or making the code even better. Kudos :)
